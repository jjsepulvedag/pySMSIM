* Im having problems with the number of accelerations I get. Check it. It is usual twice the number of elements in the time array
* I have to call target_fas with the frequencies from the white_noise. As white_noise frequencies start at 0, I need to add 0.001 to the target_fas frequencies. Check this. 
* Create different functions for the corner frequency
* Finish site spectrum
* Nyquist frequency ... How can I incorporate it?
